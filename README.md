# 📘 Java Full-Stack Training Repository

This repository is used to **track my learning progress** as I train to become a **Java Full-Stack Developer (Spring Boot focused)**.

It contains practice assignments, weekly assessments, experiments, and concept-based programs created during training.  
The goal of this repo is **consistent practice, revision, and progress tracking** rather than polished production projects.
